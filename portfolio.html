            <li><p>Reason why I decided to take a class on programming its because I enjoy the process of creation that comes with programming and the more languages you know, the more ways you’ll have to think about problems in any language. The more ways you can think, the easier it will be to find interesting ways to solve problems, and therefore to have inspiring projects.</p></li>
