        <p>My names are <strong>Joseph Muema Mwangangi.</strong>Currently a student at <span class="current">Moringa school.</span></strong> I have under gone primary, secondary and university education.On my free time I enjoy listening to music and Learning new things from the Internet. Most of my time is spent on my laptop.That is just a tip of the iceberg about me. </p>
        <p><strong>Why I decided to take a class on programming?....</strong>Its because I enjoy the process of creation that comes with programming and the more languages you know, the more ways you’ll have to think about problems in any language, the more ways you can think, the easier it will be to find interesting ways to solve problems and therefore to have inspiring projects.</p>
